     * is performed around a center point on the 2D space, definied by a pair
     * of X and Y coordinates, called centerX and centerY. When the animation
     * starts, a translation on the Z axis (depth) is performed. The length
     * of the translation can be specified, as well as whether the translation
     * should be reversed in time.
